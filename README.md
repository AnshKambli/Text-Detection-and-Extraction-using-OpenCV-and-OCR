# Text Detection and Extraction using OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR to detect and extract text from images. The extracted text is saved to a text file for further use.

## Features
- **Text Detection**: Identifies text regions in an image using contours.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from detected regions using Tesseract-OCR.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes grayscale conversion, OTSU thresholding, and dilation for better text recognition.
- **Output**: Saves the extracted text into a `.txt` file.
